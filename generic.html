        <p>Sainik Ardhyasainik Seva Sangathan (SASS) is a registered Association of Persons (AOP), founded in 2025 by a dedicated group of veteran officers from the Indian Armed Forces. SASS is committed to the welfare, unity, and dignity of personnel from the Indian Armed Forces including</p>
        <ul>
          <li>★ Indian Army, Indian Navy, Indian Air Force, Indian Coast Guard</li>
          <li>★ Paramilitary Forces (Assam Rifles, BSF, CISF, CRPF, ITBP, NSG, SSB etc)</li>

        </ul>
        <p>SASS is built on the principle of mutual support, guided by the Sanskrit tenet: <strong>"परस्परं भावयन्तः"</strong> — nourishing one another. Our activities revolve around providing tangible benefits in healthcare, financial planning, wellness, and overall quality of life. We are not a business entity — we act purely as a facilitator, negotiating better deals (without any commercial interest) for our members with transparency and trust.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision — परस्परं भावयन्त: — Nourishing Each Other</h2>
        <p>To create a united, self-reliant, and empowered community of serving and retired members and their families — connected by purpose and supported by accessible, welfare-oriented solutions.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission — Service with a Purpose</h2>
        <p>To extend meaningful support to our community through group initiatives, policy facilitation, and welfare schemes — while building a national network of trust, transparency, and mutual care for all ranks and services.</p>

        <h2>Our Objectives — What Drives Us</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>➢ To bring together serving and retired personnel across Armed Forces and allied services</li>
          <li>➢ To promote welfare programs related to healthcare and wellness</li>
          <li>➢ To facilitate access to group mediclaim and other benefit-based schemes</li>
          <li>➢ To support families of personnel with reliable services and transparent processes</li>
          <li>➢ To uphold values of unity, service, and shared growth</li>
          <li>➢ To build an ecosystem of self-sufficiency and mutual assistance</li>
          <li>➢ To partner with credible institutions and service providers for member benefits</li>
          <li>➢ To ensure continuous communication and education on available welfare measures</li>
